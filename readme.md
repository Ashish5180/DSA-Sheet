## Labsheet 1

### Array Operations

- **Static Array**: Implements insertion, deletion, and traversal operations on a static array.
- **Dynamic Array**: Provides insertion, deletion, and traversal for dynamic arrays.
- **Test Cases**: Integrated into the code files for verifying the correctness of array operations.
- **Report Analysis**: Contains analysis on time and space complexities, utilizing Big O, Omega, and Theta notations.

### String Operations

- **Concatenation, Substring, and Comparison**: Implements string operations for concatenation, substring extraction, and comparison of strings.
- **Character Frequency**: Calculates the frequency of each character within a given string.
- **Test Cases**: Embedded in the code files for direct testing.
- **Report Analysis**: A separate report evaluates the complexity of each string operation.

### Complexity Analysis (Labsheet 1)

A comprehensive report on the time and space complexity for all algorithms, analyzing them using Big O, Omega, and Theta notations.

## Labsheet 2

### String Pattern Matching and Compression

- **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Pattern Matching**: Implements the KMP algorithm for efficient string pattern matching.
- **Run Length Encoding (RLE)**: Compresses strings using the RLE algorithm.
- **Test Cases**: Included in the code files for validating both algorithms.
- **Report Analysis**: Complexity analysis report for these algorithms is available.

### Complexity Analysis (Labsheet 2)

An additional report detailing the time and space complexities for algorithms using Big O, Omega, and Theta notations.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following is installed on your system:

- Java JDK (version 11 or higher)

### Running the Code

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project files to your local machine.
2. **Open a terminal** (or command prompt) and navigate to the folder containing the project files.

#### To Compile and Run Code for Labsheet 1:

1. Navigate to the `Labsheet 1` folder.
2. Compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac StaticArrayOperations.java
    javac StringOperations.java
    ```
3. Run the compiled classes:
    ```bash
    java StaticArrayOperations
    java StringOperations
    ```

#### To Compile and Run Code for Labsheet 2:

1. Navigate to the `Labsheet 2` folder.
2. Compile the Java files:
    ```bash
    javac StringAlgorithms.java
    javac RunLengthEncoding.java
    ```
3. Run the compiled classes:
    ```bash
    java StringAlgorithms
    java RunLengthEncoding
    ```

Check the terminal output for test case results and operation correctness.

### Test Cases and Classes

- Test cases are included within each class in Labsheet 1 and Labsheet 2 for simplicity.
- The classes and methods are structured for reusability and ease of testing.
- Each Labsheet folder includes a report analyzing the algorithm complexities.
