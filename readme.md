Labsheet 1 & Labsheet 2 - Java Code Implementation

This project contains the Java code implementations for various algorithms and operations, as described in Labsheet 1 and Labsheet 2. The project includes operations for handling arrays, strings, and pattern matching algorithms, along with test cases and report analysis.

Labsheet 1
Array Operations

    Static Array: Implements insertion, deletion, and traversal for a static array.
    Dynamic Array: Implements insertion, deletion, and traversal for a dynamic array.
    Test Cases: Test cases have been implemented in the same file for verification of the operations.
    Report Analysis: A separate report analyzing the time and space complexities using Big O, Omega, and Theta notations is included in the folder.

String Operations

    Concatenation, Substring, and Comparison: Implements string operations such as concatenation, extracting substrings, and comparing two strings for equality.
    Character Frequency: A function that calculates the frequency of characters in a given string.
    Test Cases: Test cases are implemented and tested directly in the same file.
    Report Analysis: A separate report analyzing the time and space complexities of string operations is included in the folder.

Complexity Analysis

    A detailed analysis of the time and space complexity for all the algorithms implemented, using Big O, Omega, and Theta notations, is provided in a separate report.

Labsheet 2
String Pattern Matching and Compression

    Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Pattern Matching: Implements the KMP algorithm for pattern matching.
    Run Length Encoding (RLE): Implements the RLE algorithm to compress strings.
    Test Cases: Test cases have been written for both algorithms and included in the code.
    Report Analysis: A separate report analyzing the time and space complexities of these algorithms is provided in the folder.

Complexity Analysis

    A report analyzing the time and space complexities of the implemented algorithms using Big O, Omega, and Theta notations is included.

How to Run
Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

    Java JDK (version 11 or higher)

Running the Code

    Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.

    Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the folder where the project is located.

    To compile and run the code for Labsheet 1:
        Navigate to the folder where Labsheet 1 is located.
        Compile the Java file:

javac StaticArrayOperations.java
javac StringOperations.java

Run the compiled Java class:

    java StaticArrayOperations
    java StringOperations

To compile and run the code for Labsheet 2:

    Navigate to the folder where Labsheet 2 is located.
    Compile the Java file:

javac StringAlgorithms.java
javac RunLengthEncoding.java

Run the compiled Java class:

        java StringAlgorithms
        java RunLengthEncoding

    Check the outputs in the terminal for test case results and the correctness of the operations.

Test Cases and Classes

    In both Labsheet 1 and Labsheet 2, test cases for each class operation have been implemented directly in the same files for simplicity.
    The classes and their respective methods are designed to be reusable and testable.
    Separate reports analyzing the complexity of the algorithms are included in both the Labsheet 1 and Labsheet 2 folders.
